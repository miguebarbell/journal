# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

building it:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  image: "node:18.1.0"
  script:
    - cd client && npm install
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - cd client && npm run build
    - echo "Compile complete."

    paths:
        - build

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Testing."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Need set up testing"

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "Need set up linting"."

deploy to s3:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  image: "python:3.10.2"
  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.

    - "building it"

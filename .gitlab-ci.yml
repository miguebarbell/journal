# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

building:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.

# unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.

#     - echo "Testing."
#     - echo "Need set up testing"

# lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
#   script:
#     - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
#     - echo "Need set up linting."
